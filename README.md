    {
      "mongodb": {
        "url": "mongodb://localhost/anonymit"
      },

      "mailchimp": {
        "key": "nope"
      },

      "email": {
        "auth": {
          key: "mailgun key"
        }
      },
      "session": {
        "secret": "abc123"
      },
      "verenigingen": [
        {
          "name": "Gewis",
          "bus": false
        }
